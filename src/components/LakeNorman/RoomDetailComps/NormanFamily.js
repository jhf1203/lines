                        The world's most comfortable sofa, the Cloud's modular design nods to the relaxed modernism of the mid-20th century.

Easy to customize, three slipcovered cubes available in a choice of three depths allow for endless configuration possibilities to suit your space. It's a modern marriage of versatility, perfect proportions and massive comfort.

                        Traveling the globe, designer Thomas Bina was inspired by the beauty of reclaimed peroba rosa, a dense hardwood native to Brazil. Salvaged from decades-old dwellings and abandoned barns, the weathered timbers reveal time-touched character. Natural variations in grain and hue bring warmth to the clean, geometric silhouette.

                        Rough hewn, deeply scored and kiln-baked for a distressed finish, our collection by designer Timothy Oulton is an homage to the bold forms and dramatic textures of 1970s Brutalism. The suar wood pieces are overscale and marked by hand-chiseled furrows and imperfections, with design details that include mitered corners and an engaging juxtaposition of proportions.

                        Artist Bas Van Den Hurk’s silkscreens are covered in washes of color, their markings as delicate as shadows. Hazy and diffuse, they rarely have a fixed center. Instead, the compositions appear as allover fields of subtly expressed forms and tones. His work is process based, a reflection of the actions and collaborations that went into its making.

                        <p className="selection-desc">
                        Van Den Hurk’s artistic practice is a continually evolving intellectual inquiry, one that is perpetually unresolved. As a reflection of this, he considers all of his works to be technically unfinished; he believes that all artworks are in a permanent state of instability and development. A frequent collaborator with other artists, he says, “I’m in a permanent dialogue; my works can develop and appear and reappear in new contexts. I can discuss them in new ways; I can paint over them or reuse them.” 
                        </p>
                        <p className="selection-desc">
                        Van Den Hurk is concerned with balancing his creative autonomy with his knowledge of the artists and artworks that have preceded him. “I want to create my own conditions or rules, but I’m not nostalgic or naïve,” he says. “We live in a time that is dominated by networks and by media; I’m very aware of that. I strive to detangle myself from these contexts, while at the same time I’m aware that this is impossible.”
