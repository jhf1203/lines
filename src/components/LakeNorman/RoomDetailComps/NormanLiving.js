                        Jens Risom is widely considered to be a pioneer in introducing Danish modern furniture to the United States through early work with the Knoll company and to a greater extent through his own company, which thrived in the 1950s and ’60s.

                        After serving in World War II under General Patton, he founded his own company, Jens Risom Design, on May 1, 1946, which he ran for 25 years. Throughout his life, Risom stayed true to the fundamental Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity.

                        A customer favorite since its debut, the Line Collection features geometric frames made out of precisely crafted oak or walnut. It's distinguished by its strong horizontal lines that reflect natural landscapes and lend a sense of restfulness and calm. On the Line Media Console, this eye-catching louvered design also serves a purpose, allowing remotes to control devices inside. Its roomy, well-organized interior brings order to electronics, routers, albums, books and anything else that needs a home. Working from his studio in Singapore, designer Nathan Yong designs thoughtful pieces that resonate with a quiet elegance, for which he credits the congestion of city living. “My work is a reflection of my yearning for nature in this concrete jungle,” he says.

Concentrated patches of pigment seem to pulse with energy, while overlaid marks of contrasting hues squiggle and drip. Colors push against one another, swirling and gathering to create a sense of dimension and form.

Inspired by elements of African tribal design, the silhouettes are imbued with a sense of understated, quiet luxury. The warm highlights of the organic bamboo surface are complemented by textured stained oak veneers.

                        Doors are crafted of bamboo and tempered glass; frame is crafted of American oak; interior back is crafted of bamboo.  A proprietary multistep process transforms raw bamboo into a refined, durable veneer.  Bamboo stems are split and flattened, but not planed, to create a softly contoured surface that echoes the plant's natural texture.  A clear lacquered finish and hand polishing lends a warm, burnished glow with stunning highs and lows.
