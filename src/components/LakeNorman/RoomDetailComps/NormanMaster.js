                        French for "burnt oak," our Oak Brûlé collection undergoes a revolutionary high-heat finishing process that results in deep, caramelized color and distinctive cracking of the solid European oak. Luay Al-Rawi's design echoes the minimalist spirit of the Bauhaus movement, a celebration of pure form with a waterfall silhouette lending a grace note to the linear profile.

                        The natural wood is protected by a clear sealant after it's finished with high-heat.  This heat creates purposeful imperfections; but the wood itself is ultra-stable and will not warm, bend, or crack further with use.

                        We match more collections in this room than in others, since it's the owner's private suite, is used daily, and is meant to be more minimal in nature with the focal point of the room being the lake view from the large windows.  With the nightstands placed on either side of the bed, the dresser will house a large TV mounted above.  The open shelving will be repeated along the wall facing the water to provide additional storage in the space for personal items/artifacts.

                        The Jens Bench (2008), designed by Jens Risom, is an extension of the designer’s Jens Chair and Ottoman, designed in 1949 for the Caribe Hilton Hotel in Puerto Rico but eventually taken out of production. Risom worked closely with us to relaunch the chair and ottoman and develop the bench, from reviewing prototypes to suggesting cost savings. Like all his furniture, the Jens Collection has a subtle Scandinavian sensibility that works in modern or traditional settings. Made in U.S.A.

                        Artist Bas Van Den Hurk’s silkscreens are covered in washes of color, their markings as delicate as shadows. Hazy and diffuse, they rarely have a fixed center. Instead, the compositions appear as allover fields of subtly expressed forms and tones. His work is process based, a reflection of the actions and collaborations that went into its making.

                        Van Den Hurk’s artistic practice is a continually evolving intellectual inquiry, one that is perpetually unresolved. As a reflection of this, he considers all of his works to be technically unfinished; he believes that all artworks are in a permanent state of instability and development. A frequent collaborator with other artists, he says, “I’m in a permanent dialogue; my works can develop and appear and reappear in new contexts. I can discuss them in new ways; I can paint over them or reuse them.”

                        When Florence Knoll challenged Eero Saarinen to create a chair that she could curl up in, she found the right candidate for the task. The Womb Chair and Ottoman (1946) feature enveloping forms that continue as one of the most iconic representations of midcentury organic modernism. Applying foam molded over a fiberglass shell created a single-piece form that perfectly facilitates a relaxed posture.
