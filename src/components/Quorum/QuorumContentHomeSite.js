                    <p>When the 15-story Quorum Center opened on Jones Street in 2007, its luxury condominiums and new offices brought a touch of elegance to downtown Raleigh.  It also brought to reality what urban advocates had been pushing for years: mixed-use development with residences above offices or retail space.</p>

                  <p>The fire that ravaged the adjacent construction site of the Metropolitan apartments in 2017 did indeed affect the Quorum center, costing upwards of $15M to repair.  As they say though, when one door closes another door opens.  Repairs lead to renovations, which is oftentimes a project of reimagination.  This is our reimagination.</p>
                  <p>With many residents forced to temporarily relocate, some took this as a sign to relocate permanently whether to other areas in the metro or to a different area altogether.  This created a unique opportunity to join many to make one.</p>

                  <p>The eastern half of the building is comprised of three condominimums on most levels, and for this project they have been combined into one large unit with four bedrooms and 3.5 baths.  Each room features a sweeping view of the metro.  The master suite allows views of the history five-points neighborhood as well as the lights of the bustling Glenwood South district.  The guest suites all boast views of what's currently under development in Raleigh, the ongoing transformation of the Warehouse District.  The common areas have two balconies with East and South views, as well as a complete 270 degree view of everything visible from the master and guest suites.</p>
