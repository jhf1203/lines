### Description
      
This is a front-end application developed entirely using the React framework.  The contents are some personcal residential architectural/interior design projects I've worked on as a hobby throughout the year 2020.

### Instructions
  
This application can be found [here](https://jhf1203.github.io/lines/)

### Usage
  
This is a site that hosts a large amount of data, specifically images saved internally into an assets file and image URLs referenced from external websites.  Rendering this website via react pages and components greatly enhances the speed and navigation of the site itself.
  
### Collaborating
  
Got an idea?  A bug to report?  Or even a thought on how the application could run more efficiently?  Log it [here](https://github.com/jhf1203/lines/issues) as an issue, and we'll talk about it!
